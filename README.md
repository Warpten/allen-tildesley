Allen & Tildesley Sample Programs
================================================================================

These are the sample codes that supplemented "Computer Simulation of Liquids" by
M. P. Allen and D. Tildesley, originally published by Oxford University Press in
1987.  They demonstrate many key algorithms that are foundational to molecular
dynamics simulation of periodic systems.
